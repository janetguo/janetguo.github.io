        <p>Kia ora!</p>

        <p>I'm Janet. I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_New_Zealand">Kirikiriroa</a>. I was interested in winning, so I competed in some competitions, and won <a href="https://schoolspoetryaward.co.nz/">some</a> <a href="https://www2.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/understanding-secondary-quals/nz-scholarship/top-scholar-award-winners-by-year/2022-top-scholar-award-winners/">national</a> <a href="https://www.mathsolympiad.org.nz/">and</a> <a href="https://www.ibo-info.org/en/">international</a> <a href="https://www.wsdcdebating.org/basic-01">awards</a>. I was interested in a change of scenery, so I applied to some US colleges, and now I study AI and biology at MIT.</p>

        <p>I'm currently interested in drugs: <a href="https://langerlab.mit.edu/">how to deliver them</a>, <a href="https://careers.lilly.com/us/en/blogarticle/inside-the-lilly-mit-genetic-medicines-scholars-program">how to commercialize them</a>, and <a href="https://coley.mit.edu/">how to discover them</a>. I'm also interested in helping people reach their potential: I coached competitive debating/maths/biology, counseled and reviewed admissions for <a href="https://www.sparc.camp/">talent</a> <a href="https://www.atlasfellowship.org/">camps</a>, and currently direct <a href="http://hackmit.org">one of the largest collegiate hackathons in the world</a>.</p>

        <p>I don't really use social media these days. If you want to know more about me, I occasionally write on <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/janet/">MIT Admissions</a> and sometimes write essays for my <a href="https://amatureopinion.substack.com/">amateur opinions</a>.</p>

        <p>You can reach me at janetguo [at] mit [dot] edu. I'd love to chat!</p>

        <p>Ngaa mihi e hoa,</p>
